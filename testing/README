 --== Desc ==--

This is a bunch of automated tests for gocode.

Tests can be slow, because after each request gocode server runs GC.
And current Go GC is slow. You won't notice that other than in tests
because usually you spend some time in editor between requests and
that time is wasted on a GC run, but testing app throws requests one
after another and it causes GC to eat a lot of CPU. So.. don't worry
about that.

 --== Utils ==--

There is a bunch of console utils to use when you're working with
tests.

  showcursor - Dumps file and highlights cursor position (with red
  color).

  showsmap - Dumps file and highlights each identifier which has
  semantic information in the semantic map.

  rename - Renames an identifier pointed by the cursor position and
  prints the renamed version of the source code to stdout.

  listidents - Scans the source code with a lexer, and returns the
  list of all identifiers in the code together with their positions.
