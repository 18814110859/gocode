This testing subdir is dedicated for testing the renaming functionality.

Rename feature allows you to rename any kind of language entity
inside the boundaries of your package. And in order to test that, I'm
making a simple promise:

The semantics of a particular app will not be changed after renaming.
Unless you're using 'reflect' capabilities (and therefore using a name
of the entity as a parameter) or you're changing the visilibity of the
object (e.g. lowering case of the first letter in the name).

Basically I can run through all the identifiers of an app, and change
them and it should compile correctly after each change.

And that's how I will test things. But I will include manual test cases
too.

In order to pass tests successfully, this testing framework requires
you to set this option:

	'gocode set deny-module-renames true'
