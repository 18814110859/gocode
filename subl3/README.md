# Sublime Text 3 plugin

If you want full Go experience in sublime, use [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime).

This plugin is written by me (nsf) as a result of frustration with GoSublime. I wanted something simpler and plugin has to use system version of the gocode. As you may know, GoSublime uses a fork of gocode, which is integrated into its own daemon called MarGo (as far as I know).

I don't have any big plans on this plugin. The reason why I moved to sublime in the first place is, again, frustration, but with Atom (too slow). We'll see how it goes. I think I might add gofmt on save also and perhaps it's worth adding proper support for snippets, because there is no nice way to show function arguments in sublime.

Oh yes, this plugin uses GoSublime syntax files for Go. Well, they use a fork of gocode, I'll use the fork of their syntax files, fair deal.
