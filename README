Autocompletion/refactoring daemon for Go language.

Work in progress..

Currently available things:
 - .a (archive aka package) type info parser
 - type inference (more or less complete)
 - vim plugin (basics)
 - basic autocompletion (really really basic)

Short usage guide:

Everything is pretty simple. Just 'make install' it and make sure it
is available on your PATH (vim plugin assumes that).

In order to install vim plugin you need to have vim scripts installed
from the Go source tree ($GOROOT/misc/vim). After that just run
'update.sh' script from the 'vim' dir in the gocode source tree. It
will work on mac and linux (installs vim plugin files in ~/.vim/...).
Make sure you have 'filetype plugin on' in vim and you're done! Use
<C-x><C-o> for omnicompletion.

Daemon is started automatically and it is panic-safe. Means if it dies
with a panic during autocompletion, it will drop its cache and
continue serving requests. On panic it prints stack trace also. In order
to see a stack trace you may want to run it manually somewhere in the
terminal using this command: 'gocode -s'. If the daemon was started
previously, you can shut it down using this command: 'gocode close'.
